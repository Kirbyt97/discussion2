           <h3>The Structure of S. Town</h3>
           <p>S. Town sounds much like a murder mystery show that comes on the television, like 30 Minutes.</p>
           <p>In the beginning, the podcast sounded more like a motivational speech when the man was talking about clocks. However, the narrative switched styles when the reporters informant, John, was on the phone for the first time.  </p>
           <p>Most of the narrative is a phone conversation between the reporter and John dissucsing the on goings of the town. Some of it, though, is rocordings of live conversations between the characters.</p>
        
           <h3>Who does the talking?</h3>
          <p>The investigator and John may be about equal in who does the most talking, depending on the situation. When the investigator is interviewing John about the murder, John does the most talking. The investigator does most of the talking when he summarizes what John was saying or when discussing his own doubts of the alleged murder.</p>
           
           <h3>Is it scripted?</h3>
           <p>Parts of this story are scripted. Most of the scripted parts are when the reporter is discussing John with his listeners, summarizing the days events. These bits sound like the murder mystery television shows where the host does a voice over of the conversation. </p>
           <p>Other parts of the podcast do not sound scripted, like when John is speaking. These parts are written to sound like everyday speech, not a scripted dialogue. </p>
          
           
           <h3>Interviews?</h3>
         <p>The majority of this piece is in interiew format. The reporter is conducting an investigation of an alleged murder and this podcasts outlines his initial interviews with the informant, John. Most bits of the phone call are in question-answer format. This does not pervent John from going off on tangents, but the interviewer always tries to get him back on track.
           </p>
           
           <h3>Are there sound effects and music?</h3>
           
           <p>There are many sound effects in this podcast to make the narrative sound more realistic and lifelike.</p>
           <li>Spy music when introducing the story</li>
           <li>Phone background noise
           </li>
           <li>Voice overs during the phone call where the reporter interjects his own comments</li>
           <li>Computer typing sounds</li>
           <li>Instrumental plays when the investigator researches the potential murder</li>
