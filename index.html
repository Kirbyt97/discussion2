           <h2>Homecoming</h2>
           
           <h3>The Structure of S. Town</h3>
           <p>S. Town sounds much like a murder mystery show that comes on the television, like 30 Minutes. The style and execution is very similar, with S. Town missing the visuial element, of course.</p>
           <p>In the beginning, the podcast sounded more like a motivational speech when the man was talking about clocks before the actual story got going. However, the narrative switched styles when the reporters informant, John, was on the phone for the first time.  </p>
           <p>Most of the narrative is a phone conversation between the reporter and John dissucsing the on goings of the town. Some of it, though, is rocordings of live conversations between the characters.</p>
        
           <h3>Who does the talking?</h3>
          <p>The investigator and John are about equal in who does the most talking, depending on the situation. When the investigator is interviewing John about the murder, John does the most talking. The investigator does all of the talking when he summarizes what John was saying or when discussing his own doubts of the alleged murder.</p>
           
           <h3>Is it scripted?</h3>
           <p>Parts of this story are scripted. Most of the scripted parts are when the reporter is discussing John with his listeners, summarizing the days events. These bits are what give the podcast the murder mystery television show feel where the host does a voice over of the conversation. </p>
           <p> The parts where John and the other towns folk give their accounts of the sotry are unscripted. These unflitered parts allow the listener to really get a feel for what the towns people must be like.</p>
          
           
           <h3>Interviews?</h3>
         <p>The majority of this piece is in interiew format. The reporter is conducting an investigation of an alleged murder. This podcast outlines his initial interviews with the informant, John. Most bits of the phone call are in question-answer interview format. This does not pervent John from going off on tangents, but the interviewer always tries to get him back on track.
           </p>
           
           <h3>Are there sound effects and music?</h3>
           
           <p>There are many sound effects in this podcast to make the narrative sound more realistic and lifelike.</p>
           <li>Spy music when introducing the story</li>
           <li>Phone background noise
           </li>
           <li>Voice overs during the phone call where the reporter interjects his own comments</li>
           <li>Computer typing sounds</li>
           <li>Instrumental plays when the investigator researches the potential murder</li>
       
           <h2>The Alibi</h2>
           
           <h3>Structure</h3>
           <p>This is set up much like the previous podcast, investigative journalism. This episode also mimics murder mystery shows on the television, without the visual of course.</p>
          <p> At the beginning of the episode the investigator gives the listener some background on the case and what research she has had to do. The bulk of the episode is interviews with diferent people involved with this case in addition to the interviewers personal opinions.</p>
        
          <h3>Who is talking?</h3>
          
          <p>The journalist does the vast majority of the speaking. Her speaking is combined with interviews and evidence to formulate her own rendition of the story. She managed to get first hand accounts of the murder and talked to almost every major witness.</p>
          
          <h3>Is it scripted?</h3>
         <p>Some of the podcast is scripted, while other parts are not. Interviews and phone calls are not scripted, because you never know what the other person is going to say. However, the bits when the interviewer interjects her opinion may be scripted to some degree. These parts lay out her argument and the facts in a clear and concise manner to summarize the previous conversations. </p>
          
           <h3>Interviews?</h3>
           <p>The majority of the communication in this podcast is in the form of interviews and conversations. There are several different forms of the interview in this podcast. There are clips of audio from the police investigation when the murder occured. There are also both phone interviews and in person interviews with the investigator.</p>
          
           <h3>Are there sound effects and music?</h3>
           
           <p>Music is the main source of sound effects in this podcast. The journalist does not make much use out of effects, besides music. The only other source of audio that is not her own are the police interviews used in the original investigation.</p>
